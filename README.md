The project is about basic JavaScript concepts like variables, conditional and native methods. 

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p><b>(1)</b></p>

<p>Techniques used: I to us mainly the resources made available by Technigo and used Google.</p> 
<p><b>(2)</b></p>

<p>Created an extra switch.js to tackle the stretch goals. In a first step I used backticks and ${} to make the code easiert to read then I added exists in case of an invalid reponse. In a last step I tried to replace all the if ... else statements witch switch statements. Step 3 (Subtype Choice) was the hardest. Learned that you can a switch statement in a switch statement. </p>
