# Javascript Pizzeria
The project is about basic JavaScript concepts like variables, conditional and native methods. 

## The problem
(1)
Created a script.js to approach a functioning site. Mostly if ... else statements. Including logical operators like && and ||. 
Techniques used: I to us mainly the resources made available by Technigo and used Google. 
(2)
Created an extra switch.js to tackle the stretch goals. In a first step I used backticks and ${} to make the code easiert to read then I added exists in case of an invalid reponse. In a last step I tried to replace all the if ... else statements witch switch statements. Step 3 (Subtype Choice) was the hardest. Learned that you can a switch statement in a switch statement.
